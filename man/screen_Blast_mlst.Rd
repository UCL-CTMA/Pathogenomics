\title{Screen within a reference sequence the presence of a querry sequence}
\usage{
screen_Blast_mlst(
  file_strains,
  dir_querry,
  path_blastn,
  path_profile,
  threads = 4
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_strains}{The path of the reference sequence that you want to screen. The sequence should be a .fasta file.}

\item{dir_querry}{the folder containing all fasta files. The sequences are available on : https://pubmlst.org/}

\item{path_blastn}{the path where Blastn is located}

\item{path_profile}{the path to the file containing the mlst profiles}

\item{threads}{}
}
\value{
numeric value of the percentage of the reference sequence which is covered by the querry sequence.
}
\description{
With this function, the user provides a reference sequence and a querry sequence and the function compute the percentage of the reference which is covered by the querry. This computation is computed using the GenomicRanges Bioconductor objects.
