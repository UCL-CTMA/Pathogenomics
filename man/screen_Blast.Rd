\title{Screen within a reference sequence the presence of a querry sequence}
\usage{
screen_Blast(
  file_strains,
  file_querry,
  pc_id_treshold,
  path_blastn,
  threads = 4
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_strains}{The path of the reference sequence that you want to screen. The sequence should be a .fasta file including one or several sequences}

\item{file_querry}{The path of the querry sequence. he sequence should be a .fasta file including one or several sequences}

\item{pc_id_treshold}{the minimum percentage of identity obtained with Blast that should be obtained in order to consider that the query match the reference sequence}

\item{path_blastn}{the path where Blastn is located}

\item{threads}{}
}
\value{
numeric value of the percentage of the reference sequence which is covered by the querry sequence.
}
\description{
With this function, the user provides a reference sequence and a querry sequence and the function compute the percentage of the reference which is covered by the querry. This computation is computed using the GenomicRanges Bioconductor objects.
